<font size="5">**How to use the plugin:**</font>

Using the plugin is very simple! Simply install the plugin and select the Terrain Generation tab on the bottom right. There are settings that you can change such as the length in the X axis, the length in the Z axis, block size, seed, amplitude, etc. There are full descriptions of the settings on the bottom of the label. Here are the settings and the descriptions of what they do here:

**X Length:** Setting for the length in the X axis.\n
**Z Length:** Setting for the length in the Z axis.\n
**Block Size:** Size for each block.\n
**Amplitude:** The amplitude for the noise scale.\n
**Smoothness:** How smooth you want the terrain to be. This is also the same as the noise scale.\n
**Color Coded:** Option for color coded terrain.\n
**Random Seed:** Option for a random seed when generating terrain.\n
**Seed:** This number can be changed for a specific seed you want. Range is from 0 to 1.\n

These settings don't need to be changed.

<font size="5">**What the script does:**</font>

All the script does is it makes a terrain folder in the workspace. Using the settings you set, the loops create parts that are at the position of the indexes. The Y position is calculated using Perlin Noise. 

That's all.
